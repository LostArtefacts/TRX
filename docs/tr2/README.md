TR2X is an open-source decompilation project for Tomb Raider 2, created as a
sequel to the successful [TR1X](https://github.com/LostArtefacts/TR1X/) project
for Tomb Raider 1. Our project is in the early stages, and our main focus is on
decompiling as much of the game as possible.

## The situation

TR2X draws inspiration from existing decompilation efforts, including the
achievements of [TR2Main](https://github.com/Arsunt/TR2Main) developed by
[Arsunt](https://github.com/Arsunt/). However, we emphasize that TR2X is an
independent project and does not directly copy code from TR2Main.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to fully decompile Tomb Raider 2 and to eventually enhance the
overall gameplay experience.

### Key Goals

- **Comprehensive Decompilation:**  
  Our primary objective is to achieve a thorough decompilation of Tomb Raider
  2, enabling a deeper understanding of its inner workings.

- **Enhancement of UK Box Version:**  
  Our work is based on the UK Box version of Tomb Raider 2. Eventually we hope
  to reach feature parity with the Steam/multipatch version, and possibly
  TR2Main as well.

- **Cross-platform Compatibility:**  
  We are committed to making Tomb Raider 2 run natively on Linux, with the
  possibility of supporting Mac systems in the future.

- **Transparent Development Process:**  
  We value transparency and aim to maintain a transparent development process,
  ensuring regular updates and engagement with the community.

- **Changelog and Progress Updates:**  
  We strive to provide detailed and reliable changelogs, documenting
  significant updates and changes made to TR2X. Additionally, we will keep
  the community informed about the progress of the project.

TR2X is currently in the early stages of development, focusing on the
decompilation process. We recognize that there is much work to be done.
