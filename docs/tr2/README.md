TR2X is currently in the early stages of development, focusing on the
decompilation process. We recognize that there is much work to be done.

## Windows

### Installing (manual)

1. Head over to GitHub releases: https://github.com/LostArtefacts/TRX/releases
2. Download the TR2X zip file.
3. Extract the TR2X zip file into a directory of your choice.  
   Make sure you choose to overwrite existing directories and files.
4. (First time installation) Put your original game files into the target directory.
5. To play the game, run `TR2X.exe`.
