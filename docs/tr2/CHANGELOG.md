## [Unreleased](https://github.com/LostArtefacts/TRX/compare/tr2-1.5.1...develop) - ××××-××-××
- added a game flow option for cold water in custom levels, similar to TR3 (#4021)
- added a splash effect when Lara jumps in wading depth water, similar to TR3+ (#3975)
- added bounding box debugging (`/debug 1` or `/set debug-cuboids 1`)

    Lets builders link hardcoded logic to slots of their choice, allowing object sharing between games (for example, use TR1 bats in TR2).  
    This feature is experimental — complex objects such as the dragon or Skidoos may not behave correctly. Please report any bugs encountered.  
    See [the documentation](../07-CATALOGS.md) for details.
