title: Lara's outfits
---

# Outfits

In TR1 and TR2 originally, Lara's meshes were taken from the `O_LARA` object,
with mesh swaps being performed as required at runtime using additional objects,
such as `O_LARA_PISTOL`, `O_LARA_SHOTGUN`, `O_LARA_EXTRA` etc. TR3 moved to a
dedicated `O_LARA_SKIN` object, but still depended on the additional gun and
extra mesh swaps, and these remained tightly coupled with the level's outfit.
For example, when putting a shotgun in Lara's hand, the relevant mesh would
include an entire copy of her hand, when in reality only the shotgun was
required. This meant if customizing Lara's gloves, the builder would need to do
so on several different objects.

TRX uses a different skin system, both to allow outfit swaps in-game for players
and to remove unnecessary mesh faces where applicable for a more streamlined
data setup. Custom level builders can define up to 32 outfits; following is a
guide to the data and JSON configuration, and some scenario/workflow examples.

## Data setup

The skin system uses the following objects. These are provided in the
`lara_outfits.bin` injection, and are available to download as a separate WAD
(see [injections](15-INJECTIONS.md)).

#### `O_LARA_SKIN_SWAP_1`...`O_LARA_SKIN_SWAP_32`
Each of these should contain a distinct Lara model, with the mesh count and bone
order conforming to the standard for Lara. Bone offsets are used (e.g. consider
Bacon Lara's different structure); animations are not used.

#### `O_LARA_SKIN_SWAP_EXTRA`
This object contains various additional meshes for Lara, such as altered torsos
when the TR1 braid is in use, Lara's combat face, and meshes used in extra
animations, such as pulling the dagger in Dragon's Lair. It also contains both
the TR1 and TR2/3 braid.

#### `O_LARA_SKIN_SWAP_GUNS`
This object contains holsters - both empty and equipped with the various guns - 
as well as the guns themselves when they are in Lara's hands or on her back.

#### `O_LARA_SKIN_SWAP_LEGS`
This object contains copies of Lara's legs for each outfit, with holster strap
textures removed. This allows levels such as Home Sweet Home to swap out Lara's
legs when she has no holsters. It is not an essential object to include.

## JSON setup
The file `cfg/outfits.json5` sets up the available outfits, and how they should
behave. The structure of this file is described below.

### Guns

<summary>Show snippet</summary>

```json
{
  "LGT_DESERT_EAGLE": {
    "hand_r": 62,
    "thigh_r": 9,
  },
  "LGT_UZIS": {
    "hand_r": 63,
    "hand_l": 64,
    "thigh_r": 10,
    "thigh_l": 11,
  },
  "LGT_SHOTGUN": {
    "hand_r": 65,
    "torso": 72,
  },
}
```
</details>

The map keys must match known engine weapons. See [weapons](13-WEAPONS.md) and
`cfg/weapons.json5` for reference. Any entry may omit hand, thigh or torso, and
note that specific gun types will only look for particular entries. For example,
defining a `thigh_l` property for `LGT_SHOTGUN` is meaningless and will be
ignored. Any missing fields imply that no mesh is drawn for that slot.

    <td>
      <code>thigh_r</code><br/>
      <code>thigh_l</code>
    </td>
    <td>Integer</td>
    <td>
      The mesh offset in <code>O_LARA_SKIN_SWAP_GUNS</code> for the gun to draw
      against Lara's thighs. This expects the holster to be part of the mesh.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td>
      <code>torso</code>
    </td>
    <td>Integer</td>
    <td>
      The mesh offset in <code>O_LARA_SKIN_SWAP_GUNS</code> for the gun to draw
      on Lara's back.

## Custom level use cases

> I don't need to customize Lara's outfit, and I don't mind players freely
switching outfits.

In this scenario, simply ship your level with `lara_outfits.bin` and the default
`cfg/outfits.json5`.

***

> I don't need to customize Lara's outfit, nor do I want the player to change
it.

In this case, you can simply enforce the outfit option, and continue to ship the
standard files as above. Provided your game-flow level has an accurate
`lara_outfit` entry, you can enforce as follows.

```json
"enforced_config": {
  "lara_outfit": null,
},
```

Using null here means that if your second level uses a different outfit, that
will still be honoured.

***

> I don't need to customize Lara's outfits, but I want to restrict the ones that
can be selected by the player.

Ship the default injection file, but edit `cfg/outfits.json5` by removing the 
entries from the `outfits` section that you do not need.

***

> I want to customize Lara's outfits.

Download the provided TRX WAD to access the data included in the shipped
injection. Move each of the relevant objects to your WAD. You can then proceed
to edit the meshes as required. Ensure that you remove the `lara_outfits.bin`
from your game-flow, otherwise these will override the data in your level.

> I want to customize Lara's braid.

Braid meshes and bones are taken from the `O_LARA_SKIN_SWAP_EXTRA` object, so to
customize it you will need to follow the same steps as for customizing outfits
i.e. import the TRX WAD, edit the data and remove the injection.
