# Game Strings

## Overview

This document describes how to use and translate the TRX game strings. Game
strings let level builders customize built-in object and level names in custom
levels, and translators translate the entire game (including UI) into other
languages. The configuration is structured in JSON5 format, which permits
comments and supports a layering mechanism for overrides.

## Audiences

This document serves two main audiences:

- **Level builders**: Customize object names, level titles, and UI strings for
  custom levels and mod packs.
- **Translators**: Translate the full game text (gameplay, UI, and menus) into
  different languages.

## Quick‑start example

```json5
{
    // Override only the key_item_1 pickup in Level 0
    "levels": [
        {
            "title": "City of Vilcabamba",
            "objects": { "key_item_1": { "name": "Gold Key" } }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Layering and Override Mechanism

TRX supports multiple layers of strings files that are loaded in a specific
order. Later layers override earlier ones, allowing expansion packs and custom
mods to selectively override base text. The default load order is:

1. `base_strings.json5` — Common defaults for all engines and languages.
2. `tr1/strings.json5` — Base strings for the main game.
3. `tr1-ub/strings.json5` — Overrides for the Unfinished Business expansion pack
   (or other expansion packs/mods).

   Depending on which mod or pack you run, the third layer may vary:
   - `tr1-ub/strings.json5` for the Unfinished Business expansion pack
   - `tr2-gm/strings.json5` for the Golden Mask TR2 expansion pack
   - `tr1-demo-pc/strings.json5` for the PC TR1 demo
   - `tr*-level/strings.json5` for the -l/--level command line switch

For example, if the same key exists in both `base_strings.json5` and
`tr1/strings.json5`, the value `tr1/strings.json5` will take precedence.

Each layer can also have a variant translated to other languages - see
[this section](./GAME_STRINGS.md#translating-each-layer).

## General structure

The document is organized as follows:

### Objects that stand for other objects

An object entry can name another object instead of holding its own fields:

```json5
"objects": {
    "key_item_1": {"name": "Gold Key"},
    "key_option_1": "$objects/key_item_1"
}
```

The object reads fields from the object it names, including `name` and
`description`. A level that renames that object renames the reference too.
This keeps an inventory option in step with the item it shows. Reference
entries hold no text, so translation files do not need them.

### Object entry fields

    <td>String&nbsp;/&nbsp;String&nbsp;array</td>
    <td>No</td>
    <td>
      Object entry field (<code>objects.&lt;id&gt;.name</code>).
      Allows renaming any object, including key items and pickups. Can be a
      list of strings: inventory objects use the first name; additional names
      can be used with commands like <code>/tp</code> and <code>/give</code>.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr valign="top">
    <td>
      <code>description</code>
    </td>
    <td>String</td>
    <td>No</td>
    <td>
      Object entry field (<code>objects.&lt;id&gt;.description</code>).
      Defines longer text for key and puzzle items. Use <code>\n</code> for
      new lines and <code>\f</code> for page breaks. Empty strings suppress the
      examine text UI.
    </td>
  </tr>

> [!NOTE]
> The `extends` property now refers to another language code, not a file path.
> When present in the common strings layer, the manager will first load the
> parent language (and any further `extends` chains), then apply the current
> file's overrides. Cyclic `extends` chains are detected and will emit a
> warning rather than infinite recursion.

> [!NOTE]
> Nearly all pickup items exist in two forms, as early games differentiate
> between a sprite displayed on the ground and a 3D object depicted in the
> inventory ring. Each form has its own key, and the inventory one references
> the ground one, so renaming the ground key renames both. Secrets are a
> notable exception, as they never appear in the inventory ring in the
> original game.

## Translation Workflow

### Translating each layer <a name="translating-each-layer"></a>

To provide localized translations, place language-specific overrides alongside
each base file using the naming pattern `<basename>-<lang>.json5`. Translation
files must live in the same directory as their base (e.g. `cfg/`, or
`games/<game-id>/`). For example, to add French translations:

```text
cfg/base_strings-fr.json5            # common strings
games/tr1/strings-fr.json5           # TR1 base game strings
games/tr1-demo-pc/strings-fr.json5   # TR1 demo overrides
games/tr1-level/strings-fr.json5     # TR1 custom-level pack overrides
games/tr1-ub/strings-fr.json5        # TR1: Unfinished Business overrides
games/tr2/strings-fr.json5           # TR2 base game strings
games/tr2-level/strings-fr.json5     # TR2 custom-level pack overrides
games/tr2-gm/strings-fr.json5        # TR2: Golden Mask overrides
```

When the game starts, TRX will detect these files and load them in place of the
default layer for that language code (`fr` in this example). Omit any
translation file for a layer you do not need; the game will fall back to the
English base for that layer by default.

### Live reloading (`/strings`)

To apply changes to string files without restarting the game, use the `/strings`
console command. It reloads all string layers for the current language (common,
base, and mod-specific), making it easy to test translation or custom overrides
on the fly.

In addition, languages can be switched at runtime without the need to use the
UI with the `/set language <code>` console command (e.g. `/set language fr`).

New language files are only detected at the game launch. If you create a new
layer file, you'll need to relaunch the game to see the effects.

### Review system

The development team uses AI-assisted tools to create initial translations.
Automated translations are tagged with a special marker `\{review}` indicating
that the text needs human review. By default, review markers are hidden in-game.
To enable review mode and display markers, run:

```
/set review 1
```

Translators should remove the `\{review}` tags once the translation has been
reviewed and finalized.

### `language_name`

Only supported in the common strings file (`base_strings.json5`), the
`language_name` property sets the display name of the language in the options
menu. For example:

```json5
{
    "language_name": "Français"
}
```

## Custom levels

### General tips

- **Zero-indexed levels**: Levels are zero-indexed and match the order in the
  game flow file.
- **Minimal overrides**: Only define the strings you need; the game will fall
  back to built-in defaults for any missing entries. For example:
  ```json5
  {
      "levels": [
          {
              "title": "City of Vilcabamba",
              "objects": {
                  "key_item_1": {"name": "Gold Key"}
              }
          }
      ]
  }
  ```
- **Renaming any object**: You can rename puzzle items, keys, enemies, or any
  other in-game object. For example, TR2 object #&NoBreak;39 (tiger) can be
  renamed to "Snow Leopard" in a winter-themed level.

### Console and object IDs

All objects have names, even if they are not shown in the UI. Use these names
with console commands such as `/tp` or `/give`. For example, `/tp tiger`
teleports Lara to object #&NoBreak;39. Console commands accept partial,
case-insensitive names, and will match unique substrings to objects (powered by
fuzzy matching). In case the player uses languages other than English, the
commands also accept builtin English names (so even though wolf is called a
wilk in Polish, on top of `/tp wilk` the players can still `/tp wolf`).

For a complete list of object IDs for a specific engine, refer to the game
strings files shipped with the relevant TRX builds.
