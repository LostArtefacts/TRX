# Commands

TRX introduces a developer console, by default accessible with the <kbd>/</kbd> key.
This key can be rebound in the controls dialog to anything of your choice. Note that
where <kbd>/</kbd> is used in command documentation, you should interpret that as
whichever key you have bound, and not include it as part of the command itself.

## Gameplay commands

- `/help`  
  `/help {command}`  
  Shows a list of the available commands or a detailed help message for the chosen one. Even Lara needs a lifeline!

- `/pos`  
  Reveals Lara's exact coordinates in the universe. Knowledge is power!

- `/tp {room_number}`  
  `/tp room {room_number}`  
  `/tp r{room_number}`  
  `/tp item {item_number}`  
  `/tp i{item_number}`  
  `/tp precise {x} {y} {z}`  
  `/tp {x} {y} {z}`  
  `/tp {object}`  
  `/tp enemy`  
  `/tp pickup`  
  Instant travel! Teleports Lara to:
  - a random spot within the specified room;
  - an item's position by item number;
  - the specified X,Y,Z coordinates in grid units;
  - the specified world-space coordinates with `precise` (no `1024` scaling);
  - the next pickup in round-robin order with `pickup`;
  - the next hostile creature in round-robin order with `enemy`;
  - the nearest object of a specific type.
  - legacy: `/tp {room_number}` is still accepted.

- `/hp`  
  `/hp {health}`  
  Displays or sets Lara's health. Tougher trials await!

- `/heal`  
  Tough day, Lara? Heals our girl back to full health.

- `/poison`  
  `/poison {num}`  
  `/poison {num} -t`  
  Displays or sets Lara's poison level. Snake bites on demand! In TR4, use `-t` to set the target level instead, letting the venom creep in gradually – and fester if left untreated.

- `/burn`
- `/burn on`
- `/burn off`
  Displays a remarkable disregard for basic fire safety. Toggles whether or not Lara is on fire.

- `/dry`  
  Dries Lara off after a swim, cutting the dramatic dripping short. Towel service, on demand!

- `/give {item_name}`  
  `/give {num} {item_name}`  
  `/give all`  
  `/give guns` or `/guns`  
  `/give moreguns` or `/moreguns`  
  `/give keys` or `/keys`  
  Gives Lara an item. Try `/give guns` to arm her to the teeth, and `/give keys` to get her all important puzzle items. Ain't nobody got time for searching! `/give all` hands over one of everything, ammunition and medipacks included.

- `/secret`  
  `/secret {num}`  
  `/secret take`  
  `/secret take {num}`  
  `/secret give`  
  `/secret give {num}`  
  Uncovers Lara's secret stash: list discovered secrets, pilfer one or all with `take`, or gift one or all back with `give`. A number on its own is a gift.

- `/kill`  
  `/kill all`  
  `/kill {enemy_type}`  
  Tired of all of those pesky creatures and goons trying to spoil your adventure? Instantly dispose of the nearest one, or kill them all at once.

- `/fly`  
  `/fly on`  
  `/fly off`  
  Turns on the fly cheat. Why even walk? Levitate like a legend.

- `/immune`  
  `/immune on`  
  `/immune off`  
  Turns on immunity, making Lara impervious to harm. Perfect for when you'd rather explore every nook than tiptoe past traps.

- `/restless`  
  `/restless on`  
  `/restless off`  
  Turns on infinite sprint. Lara's always been a speedster, but with this, even cheetahs are asking her for running tips!

- `/teatime`  
  Calls your loyal butler to any end of the world you're exploring right now. Effective immediately.

- `/spawn {object}`  
  Spawn an object of your choice. Not guaranteed to behave, but good for testing and oddly therapeutic for goofing off.

- `/trigger {item_num}`  
  `/trigger {item_name}`  
  `/trigger {object}`  
  Force-triggers one or more items by their item ID, item name, or object name. Great for testing switches, traps, and scripted events.

  `/untrigger {item_name}`  
  `/untrigger {object}`  
  Reverses `/trigger` for one or more items.

## Configuration commands

  - use `-` as `{value}` to restore the option to default.
  - level-enforced options cannot be changed unless `--force` or `-f` is used.
  - the force flag can appear anywhere in the command.
  - forced changes to level-enforced options last for the current session and are not saved while the option remains enforced.

- `/rule`<br>
  `/rule {rule}`<br>
  `/rule {rule} {value}`<br>
  `/rule {rule} -`<br>

  - use `-` as `{value}` to restore the rule to default.
  - rules are saved with your game and restored with it; a new game starts from the defaults.
  - rule names use `-`, not `_`, same as options.

  - room portals - wait, there are _how_ many rooms?!
  - room clip rectangles – the source of developers nightmares.

  - bounding boxes – to marvel at the collision code.

  `/speed {num}`  
  Displays or sets the speed of the game. Because sometimes you want to moonwalk through mayhem.

- `/music {track_id}`  
  Shows the currently playing track, stops all music with `stop`, or plays a music track by its ID. Perfect for setting the mood at will.

- `/level {num}`  
  `/level {name}`  
  `/play {num}`  
  `/play {name}`
