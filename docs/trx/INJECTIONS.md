# Injections (`.bin` files)

In TRX, an *injection* is a binary patch file (`.bin`) that the engine applies
to level data at load time. Injections are used to fix or extend base game data
in a way that stays compatible with custom levels (unless you intentionally
replace the same data in your own WAD).

Most builders only need injections for the "default TRX assets" (extra Lara
animations, extended fonts, PDA model, etc).

## How injections are configured (gameflow)

Gameflow JSON supports injections in two places:

- **Global injections**: applied to all levels.
- **Per-level injections**: applied only for that level, optionally inheriting global injections.

By default, injections defined in the global gameflow are applied to every
level. If a level defines its own injections, those are merged with the global
set when the level loads.

Individual levels can set `inherit_injections` to `false`. In that case, global
injection files are not used. If such a level defines its own `injections`,
only those are applied; if it defines none, nothing is injected.

Relevant keys (names may differ slightly per gameflow version):

```json5
{
  // global
  "injections": [
    "data/injections/lara_extra.bin",
    "data/injections/font.bin"
  ],

  "levels": [
    {
      "path": "data/levels/MY_LEVEL.TR2",
      "inherit_injections": true,
      "injections": [
        "data/injections/pda_model.bin"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> If you **import** the assets into your level WAD (see below), you should then
> **remove** the corresponding `.bin` from gameflow to avoid
> double-applying/replacing data!

> [!NOTE]
> If a level should **not** receive the global injections, set
> `"inherit_injections": false` (or omit inheritance, depending on the
> schema/version you're targeting).

> [!NOTE]
> The gameflow ignores referenced injection files that do not exist, but it's
> best practice to remove references to keep gameflow clean.

## Builder workflow: keep the `.bin`, or bake into your WAD

You can handle TRX default assets in two ways:

1. **Keep using injections** (recommended for most cases):
   ship the `.bin` files and reference them in gameflow.
2. **Bake assets into your WAD**:
   import the provided assets into your level's WAD, then remove the related
   `.bin` references from gameflow.

### Common steps for importing TRX assets into your WAD (WadTool)

1. Open your level's WAD in **WadTool**.
2. Open the extracted `.wad2` file for the applicable game as the **source level** in WadTool.
3. Move the required assets from the source to the destination, replacing the existing ones.
4. Follow any asset-specific notes in the table below.
5. Update your gameflow to remove references to the asset's `.bin` file.

TRX provides asset packs intended for WadTool import:

- [TR1 Assets Pack](https://lostartefacts.dev/pub/tr1-assets.zip)
- [TR2 Assets Pack](https://lostartefacts.dev/pub/tr2-assets.zip)
- [TR3 Assets Pack](https://lostartefacts.dev/pub/tr3-assets.zip)

The zips also include Tomb Editor catalogs (`Moveables.xml` /
`SpriteSequences.xml`) so TRX object names show up (and to enable cross-game
placements like TR2 guns in TR1 levels). See the README inside the zip for
details.

## Builder note on custom levels

Custom levels should generally not rely on injections for correctness; instead,
provide data that is already correct and consistent.

Note, however, that the injections that relate to Lara can work in custom levels
that do not modify Lara's default mesh structure or animations. These injection
files are based on the original Lara model.

If you remove the `lara_animations.bin` or `lara_extra.bin` injections, import
the relevant objects into your WAD from the assets list above. If you do not
wish to use certain animations, enforce and/or hide the corresponding config
options.

Some of Lara's default animations must be configured in a specific way - for
example, to enable TR1-style jumping in TR3 levels using the correct state
changes that the engine expects. It is therefore important that Lara is set up
correctly, whether you use the injection files or the WAD import approach.

## Default injection files (reference)

The rule of thumb for custom levels is that if an injection file name starts
with a level name, it is meant for specific original levels and should
generally be removed from your custom gameflow unless you know what you're doing.

### Core files useful for most builders

| Injection file                        | Usage    | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| `lara_animations.bin`                 | TR1, TR2 | Lara animations/state/commands (jump-twist, somersault, underwater roll, wading, etc). If Lara's appearance is customised, move the source object to another slot and replace meshes manually. **TR1 only:** add `wet-feet.xml` to the sound catalogue (adds sound IDs 15 & 17) and provide the referenced wet-feet `.wav` samples (or your own). |
