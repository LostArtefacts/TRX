## Game flow commands

The command allows you to modify the original game flow, but please note that
deviations from the original script may result in unexpected behavior. If you
encounter any bugs, we encourage you to report your experience by opening an
issue on GitHub. The overall structure is as follows:

```json5
{
  "command": "play_level",
  "param": 5,
}
```

Currently the following commands are available.
