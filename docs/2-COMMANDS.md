# Commands

TRX introduces a developer console, by default accessible with the <kbd>/</kbd> key.
This key can be rebound in the controls dialog to anything of your choice. Note that
where <kbd>/</kbd> is used in command documentation, you should interpret that as
whichever key you have bound, and not include it as part of the command itself.

## Gameplay commands

- `/help`  
  `/help {command}`  
  Shows a list of the available commands or a detailed help message for the chosen one. Even Lara needs a lifeline!

  `/tp {x} {y} {z}`  
  `/tp {object}`  
  Instant travel! Teleports Lara to a random spot within the specified room, the specified X,Y,Z coordinates, or the nearest object of specific type.

  `/hp {health}`  
  Displays or sets Lara's health. Tougher trials await!

  `/secret take`  
  `/secret take {num}`  
  `/secret give`

- `/kill`  
  `/kill all`  
  `/kill {enemy_type}`

## Configuration commands

  `/set {option} {value}`  
  `/set {option} -`
