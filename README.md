Welcome to **TRX** – an open-source reimplementation of **Tomb Raider 1** and **Tomb Raider 2**, respectively. Both projects aim to enhance these classic games through decompilation and the implementation of open-source alternatives to proprietary components.

## Q&A

1. **Is the game fully playable from beginning to the end?**

    By all means! If you encounter a bug, please file a ticket.

2. **Can we get HD textures? Reflections? Other visual updates?**

    We hope so! Being able to introduce skyboxes to TR1 showed that quite
    literally sky is the limit. But great stuff takes time.

4. **Can I play this on Mac, Linux, Android...?**

    Currently supported platforms include Windows, Linux and macOS for TR1X,
    and Windows for TR2X.

5. **What's the relation to TR2Main?**

    Originally founded as TR1Main in 2021, our project flourished independently
    without sharing the code, with the shared brand concept existing only as an
    idea. To better represent this, we rebranded to Tomb1Main. In 2023, we
    further refined our identity by adopting the name TR1X. Meanwhile, TR2Main
    follows a completely separate and unique path, unconnected to our
    development work.
