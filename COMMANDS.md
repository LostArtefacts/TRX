# Commands
TR1X introduces a developer console, by default accessible with the <kbd>/</kbd> key.
Currently supported commands:

- `/pos`  
  Retrieves precise information about Lara's coordinates. Knowledge is power!

- `/tp {room_number}`  
  `/tp {x} {y} {z}`  
  Instant travel! Teleports Lara into a random spot within the specified room, or the specified X,Y,Z coordinates.

- `/flip`  
  `/flip off`  
  `/flip on`  
  Switches the global flipmap on or off, turning the reality around you on its head.

- `/give {item_name}`  
  `/give {num} {item_name}`  
  Gives Lara an item. Try `/give guns` to arm her to the teeth, and `/give keys` to get her all important puzzle items. Ain't nobody got time for searching!

- `/kill`  
  `/kill all`  
  Tired of bats, crocs, rats, lions, Frenchmen and literally every living thing trying to spoil your adventure? This command instantly disposes a single nearest enemy, or kills them all at once.

- `/fly`  
  Turns on the fly cheat. Why even walk?
